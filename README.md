# Amdiron

I wrote this text editor for fun, and to see if I could. It is a graphical
user interface, and allows the user to create, open, edit, and save documents.
I programmed this program by hand. 


I wrote this program to work on Ubuntu. I have tested it on Ubuntu 15.04, using the Tkinter library. I do not know if it will work on Mac or Windows.


Note that while it can save files, it saves them in the same directory as the program is in.
